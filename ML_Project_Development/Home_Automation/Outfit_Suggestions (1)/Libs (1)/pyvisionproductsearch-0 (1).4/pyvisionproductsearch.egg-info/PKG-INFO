Description: # Vision Product Search Wrapper
        This library is a Python wrapper around the [Cloud Vision Product Search Libary](https://cloud.google.com/vision/product-search/docs). It makes this tool easier to use by allowing you to initalize a `ProductSearch` object once with all of your credentials. It's object-oriented, so that you don't have to be constantly ferrying around names and paths and project ids.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        ```
        from visionproductsearch.ProductSearch import ProductSearch, ProductCategories
        
        # Initialize ProductSearch with your credentials
        
        ps = ProductSearch(`my_gcp_project_id`, 'us-west1', 'path/to/creds.json', 'my_gcp_bucket_name' )
        
        # Create a new product set
        productSet = ps.createProductSet('my_test_set')
        
        # Create a new product
        product = ps.createProduct('my_fancy_shirt', ProductCategories.APPAREL)
        
        # Add a reference image to a product
        product.addReferenceImage('./skirt_pic.jpg')
        
        # List all reference images for a product
        for img in product.listReferenceImages():
            print(img)
        
        # Add a product to a product set
        product.addProduct(product)
        
        # List all products in a product set
        for p in productSet.listProducts():
            print(p)
        
        # Search for similar products by image
        productSet.search(ProductCategories.APPAREL, file_path='img/to/search.jpg')
        
        ```
        
        Note that this is not a wrapper around _all_ the functions in the Product Search library, but feel free to add them as a contributor!
